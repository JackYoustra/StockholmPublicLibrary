Asplund's first rendition of the building is a very harsh conquering of the hill behind the building - it was all terraced. This was changed in his second rendition, with a small building at the top of the hill and the rest of the hill intact, leaving a park behind the building. His final rendition removed buildings, vastly simplified the park, and twisted off the main library from the rectilinear of the city grid. This is just one way he shows that the library is conflicted and complex: a junction between the orderly city and the organic park.`}</Text>
